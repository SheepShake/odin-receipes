        <p>For this lazy wonton soup, you skip making filled wontons, and drop pork meatballs and quartered wonton wrappers right into the gingery, flavorful broth. </p>
        <p>This recipe is SO delicious!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts chicken stock or broth</li>
            <li>1 bunch green onions, divided</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 (3-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled, or 2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>3 heads baby bok choy, roughly chopped (about 3 cups)</li>
            <li>20 wonton wrappers, cut into quarters</li>
            <li>Sriracha hot sauce or chili crunch (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken stock in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cut white parts of green onions into 1-inch pieces and add to broth. Add garlic clove. Thinly slice 1 inch ginger (or 1 teaspoon ground)  and add to stock. Add 1 tablespoon soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Place pork in a bowl. Finely slice remaining green parts of green onions. Set aside 3 tablespoons for garnish. Add remaining onions to the bowl; grate in remaining 2-inch piece of ginger. Add remaining soy sauce, remaining salt, sesame oil, and cornstarch to the bowl; mix until well combined. </li>
            <li>Form mixture into 1-inch balls and add to broth. Alternatively, use a small spoon to drop heaping teaspoons full of meat into broth. Reduce heat to a simmer; cook 5 minutes. Add wonton wrappers, bok choy, and additional soy sauce to taste. Cook 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Serve with reserved green onions and hot sauce or chili crisp if desired.</li>
        </ol>
