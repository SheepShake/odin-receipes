I have touched a surface of HTML, not yet CSS. 
Some common elements and tags in HTML, like <p>, <img>, <li> etc.
Also I have learned about the boilerplate of the html, had an understanding of some useage of its content
now I am going to start from the scratch to do this receipe project, it will be my first one, and the first one i uploaded onto the Github.
I am excited!
